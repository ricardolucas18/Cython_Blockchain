This is a revocation certificate for the OpenPGP key:

pub   rsa2048 2018-11-23 [SCEA]
      982B67E8AE1BF47A50E5665A970B15EFF6763AE3
uid          Vail De Ferraris <RicardoLucas@RicardoLucas>

A revocation certificate is a kind of "kill switch" to publicly
declare that a key shall not anymore be used.  It is not possible
to retract such a revocation certificate once it has been published.

Use it to revoke this key in case of a compromise or loss of
the secret key.  However, if the secret key is still accessible,
it is better to generate a new revocation certificate and give
a reason for the revocation.  For details see the description of
of the gpg command "--generate-revocation" in the GnuPG manual.

To avoid an accidental use of this file, a colon has been inserted
before the 5 dashes below.  Remove this colon with a text editor
before importing and publishing this revocation certificate.
